#  exec: Name of executable.  Can have $ENV{} vars which get interpolated.  
#        If bin_dir is defined then bin_dir is prepended to non-absolute exec names.
#  log: Name of log.  Can have $ENV{} vars which get interpolated.
#        If log is set to '' then no log file will be created
#        If log is not defined it is set to <task_name>.log.
