               This option is mandatory and gives the name of a file contain-
               ing the task scheduler configuration.  This file specifies the
               jobs to be run, email addresses for alerts, and all other pro-
               gram options.  The test config file (t/data/test.config) has
               further documentation.

               For development and testing, ignore task cron specifications
               and instead run each job every <time> seconds.

       TTaasskk__sscchheedduullee is a tool to run various jobs at regular intervals in the
       manner of crontab.  This tool runs jobs, captures job output in log
       files and make sure jobs finish in a timely manner.  Alerts are sent to
       an email list if any severe errors occur.

       The tool can be run interactively for development purposes, but in a
       production environment it is intended to be run as a regular cron job
       which is scheduled every minute.  If ttaasskk__sscchheedduullee detects that an
       instance is already successfully running then it simply quits.  This
       ensures maximum reliability in case of temporary hardware issues or
       reboots.

       To detect another instance of running jobs, ttaasskk__sscchheedduullee looks at a
       "heartbeat" file that is touched every minute.  If the file is older
       than a specified age (typically 200 seconds) then the jobs are not run-
       ning and ttaasskk__sscchheedduullee begins.  Note that the heartbeat file is spe-
       cific to the particular configuration, so there can be multiple sets of
       jobs running as long as none of the files collide.

       TTaasskk__sscchheedduullee can be shut down gracefully by deleting its heartbeat
       file.  (If you think suddenly finding yourself without a heartbeat
       could be graceful).
